🚀 Project Aim
The primary objective of this project is to explore a tourism dataset with key goals such as:

Identifying Top Tourist Destinations: Discovering which locations attract the most visitors and generate the highest revenue.
Analyzing Category-Wise Performance: Understanding the impact of tourism categories (e.g., cultural, adventure) on visitor numbers and revenue.
Exploring Accommodation Impact: Investigating how the availability of accommodations influences tourist performance.
Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates to ensure dataset quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in visitors and revenue distribution across various locations and categories.
Insight Generation: Drawing actionable insights and making recommendations for tourism boards and stakeholders.
Conclusion & Recommendations: Summarizing findings and providing actionable recommendations for improving tourism infrastructure and marketing.
