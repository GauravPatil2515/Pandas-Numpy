## 🚀 Project Aim
The primary objective of this project is to explore a tourism dataset with key goals such as:

- Identifying Top Tourist Destinations: Discovering which locations attract the most visitors and generate the highest revenue.
- Analyzing Category-Wise Performance: Understanding the impact of tourism categories (e.g., cultural, adventure) on visitor numbers and revenue.
- Exploring Accommodation Impact: Investigating how the availability of accommodations influences tourist performance.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and duplicates to ensure dataset quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends in visitors and revenue distribution across various locations and categories.
3. **Insight Generation**: Drawing actionable insights and making recommendations for tourism boards and stakeholders.
4. **Conclusion & Recommendations**: Summarizing findings and providing actionable recommendations for improving tourism infrastructure and marketing.

## 📚 Learning Journey
This repository also includes a 5-week structured learning program that gradually builds your proficiency with Pandas and NumPy.

### Week 1: Pandas Basics
- Introduction to Pandas library: data structures, Series, DataFrames, and basic data manipulations.
- Basic filtering, indexing, and data handling techniques.

### Week 2: Advanced Pandas
- Diving deeper into Pandas functions like grouping, merging, and reshaping data.
- Analyzing large datasets and performing complex data manipulations.

### Week 3: NumPy Basics
- Learn the basics of NumPy, including array creation, slicing, indexing, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Handling multi-dimensional arrays and basic numerical computations.

### Week 4: Advanced NumPy
- Explore advanced NumPy concepts like broadcasting, vectorization, and linear algebra operations.
- Efficient matrix manipulations and performance optimization with NumPy.

### Week 5: Review & Final Project Preparation
- Review of both Pandas and NumPy concepts learned in previous weeks.
- Application of the learning to the Tourism Dataset Analysis project, preparing a comprehensive analysis with the acquired skills.

## 📈 Project Analysis Overview
